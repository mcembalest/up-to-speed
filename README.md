# Up 2

The north star purpose of Up 2 is to give support for teaching and learning.

Teaching is hard. Telling people what they need to do and know is not enough. Our mission is to build things that make the process of delivering information and sharing skills more aligned with how people learn.

People don't learn when they are uninterested, distracted, pressed for time, unsure of the value, or not having fun. Learning can only flourish in the presence of the right motivations. We want to help make teaching and learning more interesting, engaging, time-manageable, clearly valuable and *fun*.
